 <h1>DMCA NOTICE</h1>
            <h2>Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notification Guidelines</h2>
<p><strong>Notification of Infringement</strong></p>
<p><?php echo site_path() ?> does not tolerate any copyright infringement on the site</p>
<p>It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright
infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. In
addition, we will promptly terminate without notice the accounts of
those determined by us to be "repeat infringers". If you are a
copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any content
hosted on our web site <a href="https://www.filmon.com">www.<?php echo site_path() ?></a> [3]) infringes your copyrights,</p>
<p>then you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing <?php echo site_path() ?>'s Designated Copyright
Agent with the following information in writing (please consult your
legal counsel or see 17 U.S.C. Section 512(c)(3) to confirm these
requirements):</p>
<p>- A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on
behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been
infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works on the <?php echo site_path() ?> web
site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of
such works at that site.</p>
<p>- Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or
to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or
access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably
sufficient to permit <?php echo site_path() ?> to locate the material. Providing a
broadcasterâ€™s feed and the time on such feed at which you believe
there has been an infringement is the best way to help us locate
content quickly.</p>
<p>- Information reasonably sufficient to permit <?php echo site_path() ?> to contact
you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an
electronic mail address at which you may be contacted.</p>
<p>- A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the
material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the
copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</p>
<p>- A statement that the information in the notification is accurate,
and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf
of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>
<p>Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who
knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is
infringing may be subject to liability.</p>
<p>Please note that <?php echo site_path() ?> may, at our discretion, send a copy of
such notices to a third-party for publication. As such, your letter
(with personal information removed) may be forwarded to Chilling
Effects <a href="https://www.chillingeffects.org">www.chillingeffects.org</a> [4]) for publication.</p>
<p><strong>Counter-Notification</strong></p>
<p>If you elect to send us a counter notice, to be effective it must be
a written communication that includes the following (please consult
your legal counsel or see 17 U.S.C. Section 512(g)(3) to confirm these
requirements):</p>
<p>- Your physical or electronic signature.</p>
<p>- Identification of the material that has been removed or to which
access has been disabled and the location at which the material
appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.</p>
<p>- A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith
belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of
mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or
disabled.</p>
<p>- The subscriberâ€™s name, address, and telephone number, and a
statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District
Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if
your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial
district in which <?php echo site_path() ?> may be found, and that you will accept
service of process from the person who provided notification under
subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.</p>
<p>Please note that under Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act, any
person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or
activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may
be subject to liability.</p>
<p><strong>Designated Copyright Agent</strong></p>
<p><?php echo site_path() ?>'s Designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications and
counter-notifications of claimed infringement can be reached as
follows: by email at copyright@<?php echo site_path() ?>. For clarity, only DMCA
notices should go to the <?php echo site_path() ?> Designated Copyright Agent. Any
other feedback, comments, requests for technical support or other
communications should be directed to <?php echo site_path() ?> customer service
through info@<?php echo site_path() ?>. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply
with all of the requirements of this section, your DMCA notice may not
be valid.</p>
